# Multiplayer Snake Game

Learning asynchronous networking with Lighthouse Labs.


## Summary

This project is a multiplayer Snake game clone. Developing this game provided a better understanding of how TCP networking works. It also made me more comfortable with asynchronous programming and creating TCP clients using Node's built-in `net` module.


## Credits
The server code for this game was not written from scratch! It is a heavily modified version of the single player game [Snek](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek) created by [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia).
